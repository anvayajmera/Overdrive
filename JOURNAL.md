## 10/6/2025 - 3D modeled Greartisan 12V DC motors based off of online spec  

Created baseplate for the robot and added screw holes for motors
Motor mounts are connected directly to 4 pillars on the corners of the baseplate
Motor mounts loop around the front and the left and right sides of the motor, leaving the top uncovered to place the motor into position

## 10/24/2025 - Worked on a full robot upgrade, from electronics to more CAD  

Made the front panels and stuck a camera right in the middle.
Slid the distance sensors between two plates to keep them steady.
Screwed those plates onto the baseplate and added another frame on top for extra stability, feels way more secure now.
Threw in a voltage checker, distance sensors, the Jetson Orin Nano, an Arduino Nano screw terminal, and a buck converter (that grey box-looking thing).
Added a back plate that holds the distance sensors and voltage checkers on the left side, plus another frame on top of the baseplate to use space more efficiently.

Dropped in an Arduino Nano screw terminal at the front. Added two batteries, one on each side, to keep the weight balanced.
Started working on the front bumper and figured out where to mount the camera for line tracing.
Built an arm-claw system and tested a bunch of versions until one finally worked.
