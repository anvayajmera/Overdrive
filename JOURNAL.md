## 10/6/2025 - 3D modeled Greartisan 12V DC motors based off of online spec  

Created baseplate for the robot and added screw holes for motors
Motor mounts are connected directly to 4 pillars on the corners of the baseplate
Motor mounts loop around the front and the left and right sides of the motor, leaving the top uncovered to place the motor into position
