## 10/6/2025 - 3D modeled Greartisan 12V DC motors based off of online spec  

Created baseplate for the robot and added screw holes for motors
Motor mounts are connected directly to 4 pillars on the corners of the baseplate
Motor mounts loop around the front and the left and right sides of the motor, leaving the top uncovered to place the motor into position

## 10/24/2025 7 PM - Developed front panel system for robot CAD  

Made the front panels and stuck a camera right in the middle.
Slid the distance sensors between two plates to keep them steady.
Screwed those plates onto the baseplate and added another frame on top for extra stability, feels way more secure now.

We're really unsure about the ToF sensors right now, but we'll keep what we have.

## 10/24/2025 8:25 PM - Developed additional CAD for electronics  


Threw in a voltage checker, distance sensors, the Jetson Orin Nano, an Arduino Nano screw terminal, and a buck converter (that grey box-looking thing).
Added a back plate that holds the distance sensors and voltage checkers on the left side, plus another frame on top of the baseplate to use space more efficiently.

Dropped in an Arduino Nano screw terminal at the front. Added two batteries, one on each side, to keep the weight balanced.

## 10/24/2025 8:26 PM - Developed initial front bumper prototype  

Started working on the front bumper and figured out where to mount the camera for line tracing.
Built an arm-claw system and tested a bunch of versions until one finally worked.

The issue we're having here is that we want to keep the robot length under 25cm, but the front bumper makes it reach 24cm. However, removing it would not allow us to have LEDs on our robot. ![Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 8.26.03 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTMzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--188550c333b4222e76564de5a1804e0a8d55e6de/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20at%208.26.03%E2%80%AFPM.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 8:27 PM - Started developing a complex arm/claw system  

Created arm-claw system, tested multiple iterations until a working version was established
First set out on creating an arm design.

We are aware that this will need additional improvement.

First arm design:
